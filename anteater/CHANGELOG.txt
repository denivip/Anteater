This is the change log file for Anteater.

30th September 2011 - anteater-0.5.0
* removed support for triggering a view's registered UIGestureRecognizers: 		
					UIPanGestureRecognizer
					UILongPressGestureRecognizer

These were causing problems with the auto clicker as the view just hung waiting for another click.

* added view priority, by added a file called 'anteater-uiview-priorities.plist' you can tweak the priorities of views. 
The plist should contain a class name followed by a probability (as a fraction). The view is still chosen by random, but if the class name is listed it is used with the specified probability. Never have a 0 probability as the autoclicker might get stuck in a view.
{
	UITableView = 0.1;
	TSTabBarItem = 0.1;
	UIScrollView = 0.05;
	UIWebBrowserView = 0.05;
}

* Fixed UITableViewCells - This are now more widely supported. The inclusion of the UIPanGestureRecognizer appeared to have broken table views.

* Anteater now logs all views it encounters with a list of buttons it can click. This output is useful for determining UIView priorities above.

* Anteater now fails when memory or leaks are found beyond the maximum level.


19th August 2011 - anteater-0.4.0
* Added support for triggering a view's registered UIGestureRecognizers: 		
					UITapGestureRecognizer
					UIPinchGestureRecognizer
					UIRotationGestureRecognizer 
					UISwipeGestureRecognizer
					UIPanGestureRecognizer
					UILongPressGestureRecognizer
and subclasses. We only support actions with either no or one argument being the sender. The two argument action is too ambiguous. 
* Added command line parameter: anteater_output_path
Usage:  xcodebuild -sdk iphonesimulator4.3 -target "TheElements" anteater_output_path="/Users/redant/Sites/anteater"

11th August 2011 - anteater-beta-rc3.1
* Fixed Sample Project to include anteater library
* Added command line parameters: anteater_stability_test_length, anteater_stability_test_reps. 
Usage:   xcodebuild -sdk iphonesimulator4.3 -target "TheElements" anteater_stability_test_length=40 anteater_stability_test_reps=2
